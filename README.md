# DoIt
A way to organize your life. An application that will help you in your daily duties, to keep you organized and to do the things you never finished. 

I built this entire application based on the 
firbaseAuth-Ionic guide made by [Javebratt](https://javebratt.com)

You will have to write your duties to let the app help you keep on track.Creating a task is fast, start by adding a tittle to identify the topic and add the description.Once you've made sure that the notes are plenty, move onto another by clicking on the âž• on the home page.

## The END
#### And the last thing, you have done everything until this, and now you have nothing to do... That's a lie, becouse you always have something to do, improving the things you are not good at, tasting the food you haven't tasted ever, traveling to places you would not imagine that they were over there. There is a lot of things to do in this life my friend, so don't forget to put them on your list :+1:.
